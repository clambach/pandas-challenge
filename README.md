Written Report of PyCitySchools data

This is a great set of data compsed of fifteen schools in a complete city district.  Pass/fail rates vary greatly thoughout the schools, and this helps pinpoint trends and areas to focus on.  I start by grabbing the data from each student in each school.  By sorting the student's data into their individual math and reading scores, we can sumize a list that shows each schools pass/fail metric on math, reading, and both.  We can then compaire it tot he rest of the district by size of school, type of school, and budget per student.  


There are very easy correlations shown in this data that contribute to a student's success.  A small to medium school has a strong success rate, as schools with over 2000 enrolled have a quick drop off when it comes to passing.  It is also easy to see that charter schools have a clear advantage over district schools. All the top schools are charter and all the bottom schools are district.  However, budget per student is not as infuential as you would assume.  More money does not necessarily mean a better pass rate.
